# Security Requirements

## Simplified Summary

**SR1 – Data Encryption**
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using strong algorithms like AES-256.
- Use TLS/SSL to secure data in transit between clients and servers.
- Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive communications to maintain data integrity from source to destination.

**SR2 – Data Masking and Anonymization**
- Apply data masking in non-production environments to obfuscate sensitive information.
- Use anonymization to protect personally identifiable information (PII) during analysis or reporting.

**SR3 – Data Access Control**
- Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure users access only necessary data.
- Follow the principle of least privilege, granting minimum required permissions and regularly reviewing access.

**SR4 – Data Backup and Recovery**
- Implement automated backups stored securely across geographically diverse locations.
- Develop and test disaster recovery plans for quick restoration of data and systems after failures.

**SR5 – Firewall and Network Segmentation**
- Deploy firewalls to protect network perimeters and internal segments from unauthorized access.
- Use network segmentation to isolate critical systems, reducing attacker lateral movement risk.

**SR6 – Secure Remote Access**
- Use VPNs with strong encryption for secure off-site employee access.
- Implement a Zero Trust security model requiring authentication and authorization for all access requests, regardless of location.

## Original BRD Text

**SR1 – Data Encryption**
- At Rest: Encrypt sensitive data stored in databases, data lakes, and data warehouses using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
- In Transit: Use TLS/SSL protocols to encrypt data transmitted between systems, including between client devices and servers, and between internal services.
- End-to-End Encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive communications and data exchanges to ensure data remain secure from origin to destination.

**SR2 – Data Masking and Anonymization**
- Masking: Apply data masking techniques to obfuscate sensitive information in non-production environments, ensuring that data used for development or testing does not expose real customer data.
- Anonymization: Implement anonymization techniques to protect personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data, particularly when used for analysis or reporting.

**SR3 – Data Access Control**
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define and enforce access policies based on user roles, ensuring that individuals have access only to the data and resources necessary for their job functions.
- Least Privilege Principle: Apply the principle of least privilege by granting users the minimum level of access required to perform their duties, and regularly review access permissions.

**SR4 – Data Backup and Recovery**
- Automated Backups: Implement automated backup procedures to regularly create backups of critical data and configurations. Store backups in a secure, geographically diverse location.
- Disaster Recovery: Develop and test disaster recovery plans to ensure quick restoration of data and systems in the event of a catastrophic failure or data loss.

**SR5 – Firewall and Network Segmentation**
- Firewalls: Deploy firewalls to protect the network perimeter and internal network segments from unauthorized access and cyberattacks.
- Segmentation: Implement network segmentation to isolate critical systems and data from less sensitive areas of the network, reducing the risk of lateral movement by attackers.

**SR6 – Secure Remote Access**
- VPN: Use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with strong encryption to secure remote access to corporate systems and data for employees working off-site.
- Zero Trust: Implement a Zero Trust security model, ensuring that all users and devices, regardless of their location, must be authenticated and authorized before accessing corporate resources.
