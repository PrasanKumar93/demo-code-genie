**Note:** Each module will undergo individual testing and validation phases to ensure quality, usability, and integration with other organizational systems.  
3. **Priority 3 Deliverables:** To be decided during requirement gathering phase.  
4. **Requirement Analysis Report** – Documented analysis of all the business needs and current system architecture.  
5. **Project Plan:** A comprehensive plan outlining tasks, timelines, dependencies, resources, and milestones.  
6. **Application Deployment Diagram:** A structural diagram that shows the physical deployment of software components on hardware nodes. It must illustrate the mapping of software components onto the physical resources of a system, such as servers, processors, storage devices, and network infrastructure.  
7. **Test Case Report:** The document includes a detailed report that summarizes the testing process, its results, objectives, and the effectiveness of the testing in all iterations. This report should include details about any defects found, the stage at which it was found, and how the software was performed.  
8. **UI Design:** This includes all the wireframe & UI designs proposed by the designers.  
9. **VAPT Report:** A comprehensive document that details the risk findings and recommendations from security assessments. It must elaborate on the vulnerabilities in networks, applications, servers, etc., and the action to be taken to strengthen cyber resilience.  
10. **Security Design Document:** Specifications on data governance, compliance, access controls, and cybersecurity strategies.  
11. **User Guide:** A technical documentation that would enable the customers and end-users with step-by-step instructions on how to execute a task or process.  
12. **Source Code and code review reports.**
