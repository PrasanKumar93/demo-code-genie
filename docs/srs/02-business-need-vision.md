## Original BRD Text
The current system relies on scattered emails, intranet pages, and third-party applications for 
information dissemination and task completion. This fragmented approach for navigating to 
each element creates a cumbersome and inefficient workflow for employees, hindering 
productivity and engagement. 

The Employee Workbench is envisioned as a centralized portal that will have the applications 
for multiple departments to fulfill their business objectives. This will be a multi-phased, long-
term initiative that prioritizes scalability, adaptability, and alignment with Adani Realty goals. 

The long-term vision is to develop a portal that will grow and adapt over time, providing a 
foundational system that evolves alongside the organizationâ€™s needs and to create a digital 
workspace that not only supports daily operations but also enhances the employee experience, 
driving engagement, efficiency, and a positive workplace culture. Built to grow with the 
organization, the Employee Workbench will be deployed in a phased approach to balance 
immediate value with long-term functionality and innovation.

Through a phased approach, workbench for phase 1 will evolve from delivering 5 modules (not 
limited) to augment advanced analytics and other modules in future. The development plan will 
be in multiple phases, through agile methodology starting with high-priority and ease of 
implementation functions/systems (e.g., CMS, RERA, EHS, IGP etc defined in detail in the latter 
sections) and gradually adding more modules and features as a future enhancement (e.g., 
performance management, learning & development, employee wellness, advanced collaboration 
tools, predictive analytics, integrations etc).
